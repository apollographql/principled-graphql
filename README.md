# Principled GraphQL

This website highlights best practices for implementing and scaling a data graph. It's built with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) using [our custom theme](https://github.com/apollographql/gatsby-theme-apollo/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-apollo).

## Developing locally

Set up the website for local development by cloning this repo, installing Node dependencies, and then starting the Gatsby development server.

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Deploying

This website deploys the `master` branch to production via [Netlify](https://netlify.com) whenever a new commit appears. There's no extra steps required for the developer! :tada:
